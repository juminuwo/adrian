        <h5>Anime and Books and Stuff</h5>
        <p>
            I haven’t put much thought into my own likes and preferences, I am more in the mindset of just knowing where they are and enjoying them. Knowing exactly why I like something, knowing exactly how these things have affected my life, those are just extra. Just bathe in the ecstasy and if I come out a little different in the end then that’s fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though, saying that, I’ve definitely got a mental attachment to works that come out of Japan. Needless to say, that the words, language, culture, history etc. behind each work be it a TV show or a novel are going to be varying degrees of different than if was to be in English, it’s probably a mixture of those that I’ve internally romanticized.

        <h5>Learning Japanese</h5>
        <p>
            I’m currently at a level where I can read books on my kindle (with a built-in dictionary) and can play my cutie JRPGs (with a Google page ready to search new words), without much trouble. If I could choose to have the original text with 75% comprehension or translated/localized text with 100% comprehension, I would choose the latter 0% of the time. Check out <a href="http://www.personaproblems.com/" target="_blank">Persona Problems</a> if you want an illustration of why.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey with learning Japanese started with <a href="http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/guide" target="_blank">Ixrec’s Guide to Japanese</a>, grinded some basic Anki decks on grammar and then just jumped in VNs with a text parser, skip a few years we’re all caught up. I'm not sure if I recommend a route like mine but I atleast had fun making my own way.
