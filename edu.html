        <h5>Learning</h5>
          <p>
          I studied <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mathematics-msci-hons-g101/">Mathematics at Lancaster Univesrity</a> completing the four-year MSci course achieving a first-class honours. A first is the best grade so I’m happy but up until University i.e. at A level, I got an A in Mathematics, B in Further Mathematics and a C in Physics, which I would say shows my progress as a student since starting University. In fact, my grades specially spiked up during my third year where I started integrating <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> to try memorize the lecture notes for each course. And well, during the Anki grind I realized that once you have whatever you need memorized, piecing it all together is trivial i.e. understanding course material became a lot easier. I think it may just be due to reducing the mental load on memory allowing a more coherent thought process, but who knows, whatever happened seemed to work out for me.

        <h5>Mathematics</h5>
          <p>
          I don’t particularly have a passion for pure Mathematics, it just seemed to be subject I did the best in and disliked the least. It’s just solving a bunch of complicated problems which seemingly have no effect on real life, I guess it sounds kind of cool but at least of right now I’m pretty burnt out on pure. The problem solving will always be some degree of fun but the levels of abstraction were just getting too far to keep interesting.
